## Documentation-First Approach:

**CRITICAL: Before starting ANY task, you MUST first check the ./common-doc/ directory for relevant guidance and documentation. This is mandatory for all tasks - no exceptions.**

### Before Starting:

1. Use the LS tool to explore ./common-doc/ directory structure
2. Read any relevant documentation files that might relate to your task
3. Use Grep/Glob tools to search for specific guidance if needed
   - Quick tip: Search for lines starting with `#` to find markdown headers and quickly identify relevant sections
4. Only proceed with the task after consulting the documentation

### After Completing:

1. Review if any changes made require updating common documentation in ./common-doc/
